# CppShell
A shell implementation in C++, with a focus on OOP

Coming from a procedural background, I'm trying to get the hang of objects and C++ in general.

TODO List:
* ~~Successfully execute a program~~
* I/O redirection
* Signal redirection
* Implement jobs and background jobs
* ~~Correctly reap child tasks~~ (I think this works as expected right now, but will be more complicated with jobs)
